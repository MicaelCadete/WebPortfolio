<h3>Documentary Production - Al√©m do Campo</h3>
<p>
    Feb/2022 - dec/2022
    <br>
    Me and my group developed a football documentary called "Outside the Field" basically talking about Brazilian fans, studying, 
    analyzing and discussing about their behaviours inside the stadiums, after, before, and during the matches. 
    We wrote the entire guideline, interviewed people, studied every statistic numbers, collected and organized all 
    the information which could help us on the production.

<h3>SENAMUN - Worldwide Debate Simulation</h3>
    Aug/2022 - dec/2022
    <br>
    We were part of the biggest project that our school has ever had. It was a debate simulation, 
    basically a meeting with the leaders of each country chosen to discuss some problems around the world and 
    try to find a resolution for them. Me and my group were representing the United States of America. 
    We discussed two main topics, the first one was "Work in Conditions Analogous to Slavery" and the second one 
    "The Violation of Human Rights in the Ukraine X Russia War". I made our own paperwork to help us during the debate
    with statistics and informations (attached below), and it was really useful... 
    At the end of each debate we made partnerships with other countries based on our common ideas always trying to reach a final resolution.
    The first debate about work in conditions analogous to slavery was tied by vote, but we won the one about the violation of
    human rights in the Ukraine X Russia war, and the final resolution was a proposal of peace agreement made by us to stop the war. 
    At the end of the day, me and my group were elected the best committee of our topic's debate.
